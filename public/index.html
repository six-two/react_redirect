      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>This tool enables you to create a redirect link, that enables you to create a redirect link.
    The website you want to redirect to gets scrambled into seemingly random data.
    You can construct links that look like a something a user might be interested in, like a link to a video, discounted item, a unsubscribe link or whatever you can come up with.
    </p>
    <p>If you use it for phishing you might want to host your own redirect page (say <code>https://arnazon.com/deals</code>),
    so that you can have a more convincing link (like <code>https://arnazon.com/deals?item=iPhone-11&coupon=LNKaHR0cHM6Ly9leGFtcGxlLmNvbQ</code>,
    which would redirect you to <code>https://example.com</code>)
    Just download <a href="follow.html">the redirect page</a> and host it yourself.
    Put the URL of your page into the "Redirect page URL" field.
    </p>
    <p>You might ask yourself: "But why should you use this tool? I can make my server send a HTTP redirect. That is simpler."
    And you would be right. The advantage of this is that you only need to upload a small page once and can decide later, where it should be pointing to.
    This might come in handy if you can sneak this page (or the javascript it is using) onto a website (say using a file upload vulnerability).
  You could then use the reputation of that website to trick users and avoid spam filters.</p>
